# 🐢 Turtle Race Game

A simple, fun turtle race game built using Python's `turtle` module. The player bets on which colored turtle will win the race, and then watches the race unfold in a colorful animation!

## 🎮 How It Works

- The screen displays 6 turtles of different colors at the starting line.
- The player is prompted to **bet** on a turtle by typing its color (e.g., `red`, `blue`, `green`, etc.).
- All turtles start moving forward randomly.
- The first turtle to cross the finish line wins.
- If the user's selected turtle wins, a congratulatory message is printed.
- Otherwise, the game announces the winning turtle and tells you that your bet lost.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Python loops (`for`, `while`)
- Functions from the `turtle` module
- Random number generation (`random.randint`)
- User input (`screen.textinput`)
- List and object handling


## 🧰 Requirements

- Python 3.x installed
- No external libraries needed — only built-in modules are used.
